It is a complex educational and physical program that helps children develop independent skills, achieve the best possible mobility, assists children's speech development, will facilitate academic learning.

After the initial appointment my aim is to develop an individual program for your child, teach the family, childcare, school how to implement the program, and continue build skills with the help of weekly or fortnightly</p>
				<h2>Hydrotherapy</h2>
 				<p>Hydrotherapy is a wonderful way to participate in a therapy session. It is relaxing, calming in the same time a very efficient and intense workout.
